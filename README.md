🌟 About the Project
This project is a dynamic Freelancer Task Management Platform that acts as a bridge between clients and freelancers. It provides a seamless environment where clients can post various tasks, and freelancers can browse these tasks and place bids to offer their services. The platform also offers a dedicated "My Tasks" section for users to manage their posted or bid-on tasks.

Built with the powerful MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), this application demonstrates my full-stack development capabilities. The frontend is meticulously crafted with React for a smooth and interactive user experience, styled with Tailwind CSS to ensure a modern and fully responsive design across all devices. Firebase is integrated to provide secure and efficient user authentication (Login/Logout, Registration), ensuring a reliable and protected experience for every user.

This system is designed to facilitate quick and efficient task delegation and completion, showcasing my ability to build collaborative and user-centric web solutions from scratch.

Robust Backend:
